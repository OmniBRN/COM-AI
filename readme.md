## Overview

This project was created during the **EESTEC Olympics [developer.io](https://developer.io) Hackathon**â€” a 24-hour challenge organized by [EESTEC Bucharest](https://olympics.eestec.ro/).  
Our team placed **4th out of 15 teams** by building a **custom machine learning model from scratch** and developing a **web application** to present insightful and interactive statistics generated by the model.  
Through this experience, we learned how to **effectively split responsibilities**, **coordinate development efforts**, and **communicate efficiently** to deliver a complete product under time pressure.
